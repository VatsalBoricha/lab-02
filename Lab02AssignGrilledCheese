        <h4>
            Note:
        </h4>

        Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result
        will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

        Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".
